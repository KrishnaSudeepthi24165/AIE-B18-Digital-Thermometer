<h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>In the present era, live monitoring of the environment is gaining prominence in many fields like home automation, agriculture, health care, and industry. Basic thermometers only yield manual readings and not digital readings.
</p>
<p>This is a low-cost, real-time temperature monitoring system based on an Arduino UNO microcontroller and an LM35 temperature sensor. The sensor senses the ambient temperature, which is processed by Arduino and displayed in digital form. This system can easily be extended to data logging, automation, or IoT applications.
